Project 1: Understanding CA using Mars simulator
understand underlying MIPS programming for loops, inputs, outputs and perform basic fucntions.
Download the Mars simulator before accessing files.



Project 2: Static and Dynamic caching of trace files with Python
This project involves using Python to implement static and dynamic caching of trace files. Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a local memory to reduce the time and resources required to access the data from the original source. In this project, trace files are used to simulate data access patterns, and static and dynamic caching algorithms are implemented in Python to optimize the cache performance. The static caching algorithm uses a fixed cache size, while the dynamic caching algorithm adjusts the cache size dynamically based on the data access patterns. By implementing and comparing these two caching algorithms, the user can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different caching strategies and how they can be optimized for various use cases.
